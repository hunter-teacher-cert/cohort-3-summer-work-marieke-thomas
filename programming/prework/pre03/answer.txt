Ch 4 Exercise 1
1. Expected output:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. None of the functions in this program have parameters so the stack diagram is very simple:

main[]
zoop[]
baffle[]
ping[]

(The square brackets here represent empty boxes)

3. It keeps printing "Wug." infinitely over and over until the computer stops the program (until the stack overflows).
