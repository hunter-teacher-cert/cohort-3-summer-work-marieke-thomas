CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
Helps understand the code given
Helps track what's implemented on each line of the code
Visual-- apeals to students who process code visually

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
Time-consuming

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
Could be used to look for mistakes in code
Introducing a new concept
Recursion and loops especially
Sorting algorithms

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
Very simple code
Control flow
Arrays and 2D arrays need a different type of visualization (though you could use this to show some algorithms involving them like the method to reverse an array, for example)


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
Use colors!
Tree diagrams
Talk it out first
Group squiggle (each group member has a unique color pen and they take turns writing lines in their color)
Copy-paste the code on the screen/handout
