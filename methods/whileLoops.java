    //2) Print out the word "Hello" five times

    
    //3) Print all of the even numbers from 0 to 20

    //4) Repeatedly print the value of a variable, decreasing it by 0.5 each time, as long as the variable remains positive.
    
    //5) CHALLENGE! Drive the user crazy by insisting they re-enter a particular input no matter what they enter. Be creative. (Hint: use the Scanner class to take in user input)
